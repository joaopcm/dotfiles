- In all interactions and commit messages, be extremely concise and sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision
- Use the `gh` CLI to connect to GitHub and perform actions or retrieve information

## Plan

- At the end of each plan, give me a list of unresolved questions to answer, if any. Make the questions extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision

## Git

- Never give Claude Code credits when writing commit messages (I'm talking about the Co-Authored property)
- Never give Claude Code credis when opening PRs
